        "2. Constraints in a database are rules that are applied to the data in a table to ensure data integrity and consistency. They help maintain the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the data by limiting the type of data that can be entered into a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of Constraints\n",
        "1. Data Integrity: Constraints help ensure that the data in the database is accurate and consistent.\n",
        "2. Data Consistency: Constraints ensure that the data in the database is consistent across all tables and relationships.\n",
        "3. Data Security: Constraints can help prevent unauthorized or incorrect data from being entered into the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Types of Constraints\n",
        "1. Primary Key (PK): Uniquely identifies each record in a table.\n",
        "2. Foreign Key (FK): References the primary key of another table to establish relationships between tables.\n",
        "3. Unique Constraint: Ensures that each value in a column is unique.\n",
        "4. Check Constraint: Ensures that the data in a column meets a specific condition.\n",
        "5. Not Null Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot contain null values.\n",
        "6. Default Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples\n",
        "- Primary Key: In a table of employees, the employee ID could be the primary key to uniquely identify each employee.\n",
        "- Foreign Key: In a table of orders, the customer ID could be a foreign key that references the customer ID in the customers table.\n",
        "- Unique Constraint: In a table of users, the email address could have a unique constraint to ensure that each email address is only used once.\n",
        "- Check Constraint: In a table of products, the price could have a check constraint to ensure that it is greater than zero.\n",
        "- Not Null Constraint: In a table of customers, the name and address could have not null constraints to ensure that these fields are always filled in.\n",
        "- Default Constraint: In a table of orders, the order date could have a default constraint to automatically set the current date when a new order is inserted.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Applying the NOT NULL Constraint\n",
        "You would apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column to ensure that it always contains a valid value. This is useful in situations where:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data is required: Certain columns, such as a customer's name or address, may be essential for business operations or data analysis.\n",
        "2. Data integrity: By preventing null values, you can maintain data integrity and prevent errors or inconsistencies in your database.\n",
        "3. Business rules: The NOT NULL constraint can enforce business rules, such as requiring a specific piece of information for each record.\n",
        "\n",
        "Primary Key and NULL Values\n",
        "A primary key cannot contain NULL values. This is because a primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in a table, and NULL values cannot be used for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Uniqueness: Primary keys must be unique for each record, and NULL values cannot be used to enforce uniqueness.\n",
        "2. Identification: Primary keys are used to identify records, and NULL values would make it impossible to identify a record.\n",
        "3. Database constraints: Most databases, including relational databases, enforce the rule that primary keys cannot contain NULL values.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, applying the NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column always contains a valid value, while a primary key cannot contain NULL values due to its role in uniquely identifying records.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Adding Constraints to an Existing Table\n",
        "To add a constraint to an existing table, you can use the ALTER TABLE command with the ADD CONSTRAINT clause. Here are the steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Identify the table and constraint: Determine the table and the type of constraint you want to add (e.g., primary key, foreign key, unique, check).\n",
        "2. Use ALTER TABLE: Use the ALTER TABLE command to modify the existing table.\n",
        "3. Specify the constraint: Use the ADD CONSTRAINT clause to specify the constraint you want to add.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Adding a Unique Constraint\n",
        "Suppose we have an existing table called employees and we want to add a unique constraint to the email column:\n",

        "To remove a constraint from an existing table, you can use the ALTER TABLE command with the DROP CONSTRAINT clause. Here are the steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Identify the table and constraint: Determine the table and the constraint you want to remove.\n",
        "2. Use ALTER TABLE: Use the ALTER TABLE command to modify the existing table.\n",

        "2. Operation Cancellation: The insert, update, or delete operation will be cancelled, and the data will not be modified.\n",
